## Introduction
This is a application to show global airports, trains stations and ports. The data is from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpatokal/openflights/master/data/airports-extended.dat](openflights). Each row contains information about name, city, country, type (airport, train station, port or unknown), latitude and longitude.

## Instruction
Country selector is used to show locations in particular country. Another selector is used which type is showned. Interestingly, some of locations do not have confirmed type. Checkbox is used to show/hide data output in table.

On the right side is a leaflet map with marked locations and optionally table output.

Source code is available on https://github.com/PetraHudeckova/ShinyTransportMap. 

Presentation is on http://rpubs.com/Petra/ShinyTransportApp.
